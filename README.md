### ðŸ’» facebook_request_cleaner.py
A request minimizer for Facebook that cleans unused cookies and decodes parameters in a more readable format, removing unnecessary ones.

### ðŸ’» Meli-Cleaner.py
**Meli-Cleaner** is a request minimizer for Mercado Libre / Mercado Pago (both Web and Mobile). It streamlines requests by cleaning up unnecessary cookies and parameters, helping to improve readability and focus.

### ðŸ’» b64toimage.py

**b64toimage.py** es una extensiÃ³n para Burp Suite que agrega una nueva pestaÃ±a en el Repeater llamada **"Decoded b64 Image"**. Esta solapa detecta automÃ¡ticamente imÃ¡genes codificadas en base64 dentro del contenido de la respuesta HTTP y las muestra visualmente.

Ideal para cuando estÃ¡s trabajando con APIs, blobs o endpoints que embeben imÃ¡genes como `data:image/png;base64,...`, evitando tener que copiar el contenido y decodificarlo manualmente.
